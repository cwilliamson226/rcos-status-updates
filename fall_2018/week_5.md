## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Did not get too much done, was recovering for about a week from a sinus/ear infection.

## This Week's Plan

> I will be working on getting more routes up for data pulling to allow our full suite of data to be queried.

> I'll be working with the frontend team on how to add more customization to the queries with parameters and such.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope, being sick for a week was a pretty big block but other than that we're moving at a good pace. Should have a working demo by our presentation.
