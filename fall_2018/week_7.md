## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got the backend hosted on Heroku to allow the frontend to test and develop using it.

> Made our presentation for this week.

## This Week's Plan

> I will be working with the front end team to try and finish up our demo to have it working by Friday.

> I'm also going to sit down with Chris and potentially the front end guys and figure out what kind of customization we can add to the queries (ie. filtering)

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope :)
