## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I have been working on getting the new members of my team up to date with the current state of the project.

> I helped Nick and Gabe work on the frontend part of the project and find a sample repository to use as an example of how to develop the project. Neither of them have used AngularJS before, so I'll be continuing to help them as they continue building it from the ground up.

> I also worked with Chris for a little bit on the backend Flask server. Neither of us have worked with Flask before and don't have a ton of python experience, so we'll be learning as we go.

## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to continue working on getting a Flask server up an running, as well as trying to set up basic Docker containers for the frontend/backend now instead of down the road.

## Anything Blocking?

> No real roadblocks, just catching my team up with the status of the project and delegating work around the team while we all learn the various frameworks we're going to be using.
