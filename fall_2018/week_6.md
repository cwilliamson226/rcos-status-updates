## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Added some more routes, worked on getting our Flask app hosted on heroku for the front-end team to query.

## This Week's Plan

> I will be finishing up the heroku set-up so that it builds straight from the github repo.

> On top of that, I will continue customizing the routes to allow for us to provide as many stats as possible.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope, just working on getting a working demo for our presentation next week.
