## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I spent time working with each member to figure out what they would be working on for the semester and helped them set up baseline repositories for both the Backend and Frontend teams.

> Last week we thought that we had a repository set up correctly with a seed, but we ended up changing things around because they weren't quite set up right and now have our baseline angularjs repo located at https://github.com/Second-String/FrontEnd

> Chris and I sat down and picked a barebones repository to start with as our Flask server. However, since neither of us have worked with Flask before, we decided that we would be better off starting from scratch and building upwards instead of starting from a seed.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I'll be going through and setting milestones up on each repository for goals that we want to get done. I'll then be going through and splitting the milestones up into smaller issues for each team. This way anyone who isn't sure what to work on can just grab an issue and work on it.

> I'll also be working on learning Flask and trying to set up our server, as well as looking into putting our DB onto AWS RDS.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking, just a lot of administrative work to take care of before I can really dive deep into coding on the project.
