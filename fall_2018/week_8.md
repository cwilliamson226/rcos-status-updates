## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Haven't done too much work in the past week, but I've started working on getting the individual player routes set up.

## This Week's Plan

> I want to finish setting up the individual route for the API so that the frontend and integrate it with a personalized player page.

> Hopefully what I learn while doing that will allow me to go back the the position specific routes and be able to fix up some weird errors that I've been having with those.

## Anything Blocking?

> This Python package for the stats uses weird custom classes to store the player dictionaries, so finding out how to interface with those custom data structures in ways that they didn't plan on is being a real pain.

> Basically have to end up getting stats on all players and then searching those players for the one that we're looking for, and then return those stats. That's super inefficient and I really don't want to have it calculating the stats for every player for every game just to get stats on individual players.

> Gonna be working with Chris to try to figure out how to get around this roadblock.
