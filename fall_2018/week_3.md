## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I haven't gotten too much work done as I was overwhelmed with work from other classes and tests. I met with the front end team about the design going forward.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, since I've gotten the front end team set up for the most part, I'm going to be focusing on getting the backend repo built up and getting Chris up to speed with how to develop a Flask application

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope :)
