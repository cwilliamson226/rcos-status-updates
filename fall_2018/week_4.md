## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I decided that we were going to try and pivot away from using a database and SQL queries for our stats. Instead, we're going to be using just a python library aggregates and returns data through Flask to the front end.

> On that note, I set up the basics of our Flask architecture and set up a route or two as a baseline. I'll now be handing off the route creation to Chris while I focus on more of the data analysis side.

> Once we finish up those basic routes and the frontend has their baseline site running, we're going to sit down and start customizing the routes for more specific data.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I'm going to be working on figuring out which routes we need to implement/what we can add to our current endpoints to allow for more data to be sent to the front end

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope, everything is moving along pretty well. Having team members to help me cover other parts of the project has really allowed for us to make more progress.
