## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished up the multi-table position work for the frontend.

## This Week's Plan

> Refactor some of the responses on the backend to better suite the requirements of the stats page on the frontend. In particular, change the way names are formatted and add a few extra stats to respond with.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope.

## Notes

> Creating a standard response format when setting up the Flask server is saving me a ton of time with this refactor.
