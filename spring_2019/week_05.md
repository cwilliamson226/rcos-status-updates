## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I got the stat page set up with a basic table that shows QB stats.

## This Week's Plan

> Work on setting up a way of changing the selected position to show stats for. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Heroku has a 60s timeout on http requests, so I'm going to have to spend some time trying to figure out if there's any way I can get around that or if I'll have to shrink the request size.

## Notes

> Lots of debugging commits this week probably while I debug problems with Heroku.
