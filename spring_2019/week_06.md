## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Spent a lot of time working on getting around the 60s timeout on Heroku, but set up the framework for a position-sortable table.

## This Week's Plan

> Shrink request size for each of the routes as to stay under the 60s timeout.

> Additionally, I'll be finishing up the implementation for the multi-position table.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not currently.

## Notes

> Pug is making my life a lot easier with the inline javascript functionality.
