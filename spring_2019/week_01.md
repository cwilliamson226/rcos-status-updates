## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I've been trying to get the new team member up to speed with our code base and the frameworks that we're using.

> I've also been working on wireframing out what I want the stat pages to look like so that it's easier to develop.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I'll be working on finishing up my wireframe designs and starting to implement them on the frontend.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking

## Notes

> Had a ton of assignments due this week so I wasn't able to do much dev work, but I did a good amount of research/design that will help in the long run.
