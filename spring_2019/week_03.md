## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I spent some time reading through Express documentation and examples and began to plan out the routing setup for our application, as that's the whole source of the problem from last semester's Express code.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I'll be working on implementing the initial routing in Express so as to build up the infrastructure to build on over the next few weeks.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking aside from being swamped with work

## Notes

> I'm taking my time with this part in particular, since being sloppy with the infrastructure and having it get complicated is how I've had previous Express projects tank.
