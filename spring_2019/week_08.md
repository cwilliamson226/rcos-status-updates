## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished up backend refactor so that all routes respond with the information required by the frontend.

## This Week's Plan

> Begin working on the implementation of the initial player page.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope.

## Notes

> Not sure how I want to implement the logic behind showing different tables/stats depending on the position. Going to read some Pug documentation to see if I can find anything.

> Update: Found out that I can use switch statements with inline javascript to determine which chunks of html to render. Probably going to use this implementation.
